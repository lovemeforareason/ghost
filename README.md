# ABOUT GHOST
**Ghost** is a hobby operating system for the Intel x86 platform.
The entire OS is written from scratch in C/C++ and Assembly.
The kernel is not based on any existing kernel, but is partially compatible to Unix.

This is the main development repository.

**Update 2020/10/08:** With the recent backmerge I've fixed a lot of bugs in the kernel and
rewrote a lot of the user-space code. Still work-in-progress, working towards a version 1.0.0.
