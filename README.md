# ABOUT GHOST
**Ghost** is an operating system for the Intel x86 platform. The project is licensed as GPLv3.
The kernel and the userspace applications are written from scratch in C++ and Assembly (and some C).
The kernel is not based on any existing kernel and partially Unix-compatible.

This is the main development repository.
