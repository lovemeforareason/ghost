[[Processes]]
== Processes
A process contains one or more threads. It holds information that
is common for all of its threads. Each process has a main thread and can
have multiple child threads.

A process itself has no id, it is identified by the id of its main thread.


[[Threads]]
== Threads
A thread is a single stream of execution. `g_task` is the data structure
that contains information for a thread.

Threads running in kernel-level only have one stack, user-space threads have an additional
stack that is used during interrupt handling. The <<memory#Stacks,stack section>> describes
how these stacks are handled.

=== Types
The following constants of type `g_thread_type` denote types of threads.
[options="header"]
|==========================================================
| Identifier			| Description
| G_THREAD_TYPE_DEFAULT	| Normal thread
| G_THREAD_TYPE_VM86	| Virtual 8086 thread
|==========================================================



=== Kernel-level
==== Creating a thread
In kernel space, a thread can be created by using `taskingCreateThread` and
assigning it to scheduling with `taskingAssign`.

==== Considerations
There are some things to consider when implementing a thread in kernel-level.
When a kernel-lock is taken by a task, scheduling is disabled until the task
releases the lock. This is inevitable as it could cause a deadlock if the task
is interrupted while holding a lock.

To minimize any blocking, locks should therefore be used around critical parts
but acquired as late and released as soon as possible.

==== Exiting a thread
A kernel thread must be exited using `taskingExit`, otherwise the
task will run into nirvana and cause a failure.


=== User-level
==== Creating a thread
To create a thread from userspace, the `<<libapi#g_create_thread,g_create_thread>>`
API function is used. This function must be supplied with an address pointing to
code that the thread shall execute. Additionally to the entry point, a pointer
to user data can be passed.

A simple example could look like this:

[source,c]
-----
void myThreadedCounter(int* counter) {
	for(;;) {
		(*counter)++;
	}
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	int counter = 0;
	g_create_thread_d(myThreadedCounter, &counter);
	
	for(;;) {
		g_sleep(1000);
		printf("The counter is: %i\n", counter);
	}
}
-----

Each thread has a unique id of type `g_tid`. This id can be obtained from within
the thread using `<<libapi#g_get_tid,g_get_tid>>`.

==== Internal initialization
The thread initialization sequence uses a wrapper function for starting
the thread. First, the `G_SYSCALL_CREATE_THREAD` system call is called
and supplied with a "thread setup routine" and the "user entry" (the function
given to `g_create_thread`).

This setup routine is the first piece of code that is executed from within the
newly created thread, but does initially not know where to start execution.
To get this information, it uses `G_SYSCALL_GET_THREAD_ENTRY` which returns
the user entry to start executing at.

This entire procedure is done to avoid that the kernel must modify the user
stack to put the necessary values on it, but rather do it from within code which
is inherently ABI compatible.


==== Exiting a thread
A thread is automatically destroyed once the entry function finishes execution.
To stop execution from an arbitrary point, the `<<libapi#g_exit,g_exit>>` API
function can be used.

A single thread can not be killed from a different process; using the
`<<libapi#g_kill,g_kill>>` always causes the entire process to exit.

When the main thread of a <<Processes,process>> dies, all threads of the process
are killed.



[[SecurityLevels]]
=== Security Levels
When creating a process, a security level is used to determine what permissions
the threads of the process have. This security level is stored on the process
and applied on thread creation.

==== Existing security levels
The following constants of type `g_security_level` denote the different
security levels.
[options="header"]
|==========================================================
| Identifier					| Description
| `G_SECURITY_LEVEL_APPLICATION`| Has no specific permissions.
| `G_SECURITY_LEVEL_DRIVER`		| Has I/O permission level 3 (may use `out` and
		`in` commands to access the CPU I/O ports) and is permitted to
		use a variety of driver-related system calls.
| `G_SECURITY_LEVEL_KERNEL`		| Runs in kernel space
