Getting started
---------------
This document contains an explanation on how to build entire operating system from source.

The project consists of two repositories:

* link:https://github.com/maxdev1/ghost[*ghost*], main repository containing the source code
* link:https://github.com/maxdev1/ghost-sysroot[*ghost-sysroot*], a blueprint for the system root directory

The system root directory (sysroot) is a concept used in cross compiling. It reflects
the initial filesystem that is present when booting the OS.

When cross-compiling libraries and applications on your host system, the headers and
libraries from within this directory are used. This is required to seperate the host
from our target.


Cloning
-------
. Clone ghost-sysroot to `/ghost/sysroot`
. Clone main repository anywhere (for example `/ghost/source`)

If you want to use a different folder, see the "Tips" section below.


Installing prerequisites
------------------------
There are some pre-requisites that you need to install on your host system. Install the following dependencies:

* `apt-get update`
* `apt-get install libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev libmpc-dev`
* `apt-get install autoconf2.64 pkg-config xorriso grub-pc-bin`
* `apt-get install make texinfo flex bison gcc g++ nasm`
* `apt-get install asciidoc asciidoctor`

You may need to `export AUTOCONF=autoconf2.64` depending on your installation.

On Windows
~~~~~~~~~~
The recommended way of building on Windows is using WSL (link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[Windows Subsystem for Linux]).

On Mac OS
~~~~~~~~~
If you are on Mac OS X, you must make sure that the GNU GCC is used (default alias points to LLVM).
Use export to set the correct version:

-----
export CC=gcc-5
export CXX=g++-5
export CPP=cpp-5
export LD=gcc-5
-----


Toolchain setup
---------------
Run the toolchain setup script `toolchain.sh`. It will attempt to do everything that is
necessary to create the toolchain. Once the toolchain was built, add it to your PATH.


Building
--------
There is a `build.sh` in the main folder that installs required libraries, builds all
applications and then builds and packs the kernel.

NOTE: On some systems while running `build.sh`, I had the problem that the configure script
	of some ports would hang at either "checking for suffix of executables" or
	"checking whether we are crosscompiling". Run `killall conftest` to get it running again.

For building manually, the essential order is:

* `./libapi/build.sh`
* `./libc/build.sh`
* `./applications/*/build.sh`
* `./kernel/build.sh`

The ISO image is generated to the main folder as `ghost.iso`.


Library dependency
------------------
libapi is the lowest layer library that provides wrapping of system calls. On top of this
is the libc that utilizes libapi. libuser builds on top of these and provides high-level
functionalities.

Third-party software
--------------------
To install third-party libraries, it is usually necessary to provide some parameters to the
`./configure` script:

* `--host=i686-ghost` to set the correct host
* `--prefix=/system` to install libraries to the correct folder

There is also a simplified port installation script in `patches/ports` that allows automatically
downloads, patches and installs some third-party libraries.


Creating a bootable USB stick
-----------------------------
You can create a bootable USB stick with the following steps.

1. Convert the `image.iso` file to an .img 

	hdiutil convert -format UDRO -o converted.img image.iso

2. Find out which drive the USB stick is with

	diskutil list
	
3. Unmount the disk
	
	diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN
	
4. Write the image to the stick

	sudo dd if=converted.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m

5. Unmount it again
	
	diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN


Tips
----
* To specify a different toolchain base directory, modify `TOOLCHAIN_BASE`, copy the
	`variables.sh.template` to `variables.sh` and specify the variable with an export.
* While binutils and gcc are being built, the log output is redirected to a file named
	`ghost-build.log` in the respective build directory in the temporary folder. If the
	build fails for some reason, you should check this log file.
